# MSSA_Project
First public commit of my MSSA project, a customer database.

The idea is to present a simple user interface for an administrator to see their clients.  There will be some simple filters that allow only the relevant information to be displayed and they can show or hide as much as they want to.  There will be a search bar on desktop and mobile, and on mobile the information displayed will be minimal with a chance to easily expand any of the entries.
