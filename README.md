# <div align = "center">Customer Database</div>
First public commit of my MSSA project, a customer database.

The idea is to present a simple user interface for an administrator to see their clients.  There will be some simple filters that allow only the relevant information to be displayed and they can show or hide as much as they want to.  There will be a search bar on desktop and mobile, and on mobile the information displayed will be minimal with a chance to easily expand any of the entries.

## <div align="center">WHY</div>
[(Table of contents)](#table-of-contents)

I have a friend who recently left her job at a marketing agency and she wanted to start her own business.  She wanted me to be her primary developer, and I realized that we would need a customer database.  Rather than pay monthly for this type of service, I thought it would be challenging and rewarding to create one for her.

## <div align="center">IDEA</div>

The idea is to allow users to access all the customers in the business.  Regular users could access the system and add new customers if necessary, but they would not be allowed to edit or delete anyone.  Administrators would have that ability.

The ERD file shows the preliminary relational diagram for the entities involved.  This is quite rough and will need revision.

The JPG files "Desktop" and "Mobile" are rough wireframe sketches showing the user interface I'm thinking about.

I have written the following in a Word Document and uploaded in this project:
![Click here for document containing items below](https://github.com/jayhawk84/MSSA_Project/blob/master/Project%20Step%207.docx)
#### User Stories
These are the hypothetical users that will access my customer database, an administrator level user and a regular access user
#### Use Cases
These are some simple real life scenarios the users will encounter when using this web application
#### UML Diagram
This was drawn and inserted into the Word Document.  It shows pictorially what the Admin and regular user will be able to do/access.
#### Requirements
This is a breakdown of what the project will need to function properly.
